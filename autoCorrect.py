"""


Input: user enters a word
Output: prints out the autocorrected version of the word, if not corrected then it will print out "No suggestion"
Files: autoCorrect.py, wordlist.txt, testcases.txt

Notes: consonantPriority and vowelPriority are optional, they guarantee a bit more success rate
There are two ways of checking words in this program: regular expression (regex)'s re.findall, and traditional hash table lookup; both are faster than O(n).

.

Flow of program:
1. Program gets to choose between entering words or using testcases list (not very thorough)
2. Words are first checked to see if they're already correct
3. If not, words are sent to correctWord function
	a. A vowel change is done first using matchVowel, and if the result is right, it will be outputted
	b. Words then have their repeated letters tracked and removed one by one, with a vowel change done each time and checked against word list
	c. Either a matched, correct word will be outputted to screen, or it will be "No suggestion".
	
The vowelChange function replaces all vowels in a word with ".", which is a wildcard character.
Then the "."-filled word is checked against the whole wordlist using findall (which is a lot faster than normal search).
